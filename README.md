Voiceflow is a designing, prototyping and build platform for voice apps, which can be used as a voice interface for your voice apps, however it only allows 2 projects at a time, Hence I am giving the recording of working of the project here.

Here I have used the current weather API of weatherbit API service which responses with the description of weather given some parameters in the base URL
The base URL is **https://api.weatherbit.io/v2.0/current**
